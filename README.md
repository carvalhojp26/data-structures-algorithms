# ðŸ“˜ Grokking Algorithms â€“ Exercise Solutions

This repository contains **my personal solutions** to the exercises from the book  
**"Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People"** by *Aditya Y. Bhargava*.

The goal is to reinforce my understanding of the core concepts presented in the book â€” including binary search, sorting algorithms, recursion, dynamic programming, graphs, and more â€” by implementing the examples and solving the exercises chapter by chapter.
